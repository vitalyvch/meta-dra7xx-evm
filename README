========================================

--- replace with specific instructions for your layer ---

In order to build an image with BSP support for a given release, you
need to download the corresponding BSP tarball from the 'Board Support
Package (BSP) Downloads' page of the Yocto Project website.

Having done that, and assuming you extracted the BSP tarball contents
at the top-level of your yocto build tree, you can build a
dra7xx-evm image by adding the location of the meta-dra7xx-evm
layer to bblayers.conf, along with any other layers needed (to access
common metadata shared between BSPs) e.g.:

  yocto/meta-xxxx \
  yocto/meta-xxxx/meta-dra7xx-evm \

To enable the dra7xx-evm layer, add the dra7xx-evm MACHINE to local.conf:

  MACHINE ?= "dra7xx-evm"

You should then be able to build a dra7xx-evm image as such:

  $ source oe-init-build-env
  $ bitbake core-image-sato

At the end of a successful build, you should have a live image that
you can boot from a SD card.

As an alternative to downloading the BSP tarball, you can also work
directly from the meta-xxxx git repository.
